# Yet Another Entity Component System

## What is YAECS?

While YAECS is inspired by the ECS paradigmn, though, it doesn't follow it strictly.
The project is the product of me messing around and creating an interesting system for my own games.

## How to contribute?

I value all contributions, even critique posted in issues are appreciated!

### todo

- The codebase is ripped from an uncomplete project years ago so the project is formatted quiet poorly. Such can be seen in my usage of OOP type lua classes when they aren't realy needed. We should refactor these.
